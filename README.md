# RESTfulFrameworksComparison
## Introduction
The goal of the project is to compare different languages and frameworks for implementing RESTful web services.
For this purpose, a specification for a fictitious RESTful web service for library management was written (LINK). This was then developed in the following languages and frameworks, using only the functionality provided by each framework or explicitly recommended in the documentation:
- C# with ASP.NET Core
- Java with Spring Boot
- TypeScript with Express.js
- Go with Gin

The project was originally created as part of our bachelor thesis (LINK), which can also be found on GitHub. It compares the advantages and disadvantages of the frameworks in German. However, the code can also be viewed separately.

## Developers
